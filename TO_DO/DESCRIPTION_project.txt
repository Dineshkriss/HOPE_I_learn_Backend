#To-DO
So this is the first project to commit under the "HOPE_I_learn_Backend" Repo,
As the Name suggest I really hope that I learn backend step by step as I finish my projects.

Now lets talk about the project:

First things first I know that the UI is boring as F(is it okay to include swear words in Git,will i  get banned?I dont know) 
but who cares, I did this project to get proficient in REACT 

In this To-Do I have done a simple to do list which gets added as you type the name of the task and click add task button, 
should be very obvious and as an additional i have also included the Habit Tracker app which creates the habit with the
name you give and it also checks whether you have done every day of the week if you have done you can check the checkbox
and it saves the changes in its values in the local storage

I guess this should be enough for the abstract, If anyone have any improvs on my project do let me know.
